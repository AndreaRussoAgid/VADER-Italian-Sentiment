VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning) is a lexicon model and rule-based used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion. It is fully open-sourced under the [MIT License] (we sincerely appreciate all attributions and readily accept most contributions, but please don't hold us liable).

In this version, I have created an Italian VADER thanks to some modifications to the code and the addition of a special Italian dictionary.
